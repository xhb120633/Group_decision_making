The codes contains analysis from model-free to model-based, including codes generating main figures in the paper and supplementary materials. All the model fitting processes are implmented in Matlab, while the rest of the analysis (model-free analysis, parameter comparsion, parameter-survey correlation and SEM) are all implemented in R. Go to corresponding the folders to check the relevant analysis.


The Behavioral data and a complete set of model fitting results are stored in OSF:
You can get access to the data as well as download the codes to replicate our results or analyze with some new explorations.

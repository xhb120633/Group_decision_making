The codes contains analysis from model-free to model-based, including codes generating main figures in the paper and supplementary materials. All the model fitting processes are implmented in Matlab, while the rest of the analysis (model-free analysis, parameter comparsion, parameter-survey correlation and SEM) are all implemented in R. Go to corresponding folders to check the relevant analysis.

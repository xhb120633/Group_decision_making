# Group Decision Making: Analysis and Results

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis from model-free to model-based approaches. Here you will find codes that generate the main figures in the paper, as well as supplementary materials. The analysis is divided based on the software used:

- **Matlab** for model fitting processes.
- **R** for:
  - Model-free analysis.
  - Parameter comparison.
  - Parameter-survey correlation.
  - Structural equation modeling (SEM).

## Data Access

The behavioral data, along with a complete set of model fitting results, can be accessed and downloaded from [OSF](https://osf.io/8p9r3/). This allows you to replicate our results or explore new analytical paths.

## Tools & Frameworks

### Variational Bayesian Approach (VBA Toolbox)
- We employed the VBA toolbox to fit our models using a Variational Bayesian Approach.
- **Reference**: Daunizeau, J., Adam, V., & Rigoux, L. (2014). VBA: A Probabilistic Treatment of Nonlinear Models for Neurobiological and Behavioural Data. PLoS Comput Biol, 10(1), e1003441.
- For a detailed guide on using the toolbox, please visit the [VBA Toolbox Wiki](https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/wiki/).

### IGT Toolbox
- The fitting codes also utilize the IGT toolbox, developed by Romain Ligneul (2019). This aids in more efficient model fitting and post-fitting analysis.
- We incorporated our custom model codes within the IGT toolbox framework.
- Explore the IGT toolbox further on [GitHub](https://github.com/romainligneul/igt-toolbox).
